### Hi there 👋


🌱 I'm available as a freelancer (mostly python, angular, AI or just to bootstrap best practices in your venture),
👯 I'm working over a new tool: a no-code platform called Banana Army,
🧠 I'm a big fan/user of FastAPI, Angular, Nx, GCP,
💬 Ask me about anything! ;) But I got a degree in computer vision and deep learning so I know more stuff there!

⚡ Fun fact: my dog is called Java 🐶💛, my next dog will be Python

📫 How to reach me: via Linkedin

🔭 I’m the (co-)founder of

- Rumble Studio 🎙️, helping people and companies produce and share audio content with no skills
- [WIP 🍌🪖] Banana Army, a no-code platform with a focus over inclusivity, accessibbility and ecological impact,
- [WIP 💬] Spoken, an alternative to Rumble Studio, with a focus over flexibility while designing interviews,

I previously worked over other projects:

- [RIP 🪦 🎥🧠] Mimo Vision, a SaaS to take advantage of existing surveillance camera networks and let you control your image, up to monetize your tracking rights with partners,
- [RIP 🪦 💻🤓🛠️] Boosty, a SaaS to use AI (Computer Vision, NLP and RL) to analyse existing platforms (web or desktop) and generate up-to-date components

I want to work over:

- Kokoi: a SaaS to help writers write
- Boosty: make it live again :)
- a lot of other things!
