### Hi there 👋


🌱 I'm available as a freelancer (mostly python, Angular, AI or just to bootstrap best practices in your venture),
🧠 I'm a big fan/user of FastAPI, Angular, Nx, GCP,
💬 Ask me about anything! ;) But I got a degree in computer vision and deep learning so I know more stuff there!

⚡ Fun fact: my dog is called Java 🐶💛, my next dog will be Python

📫 How to reach me: via Linkedin

🔭 I’m the (co-)founder of

- 🎙️ Rumble Studio, helping people and companies produce and share audio content with no skills
- [WIP] 💬 Spoken , the future version of Rumble Studio, with a focus over flexibility while designing interviews,


I previously worked over other projects:

- [on hold] 🍌🪖 Banana Army  , a no-code platform with a focus over inclusivity, accessibbility and ecological impact,
- [RIP 🪦] 🎥🧠 Mimo Vision, a SaaS to take advantage of existing surveillance camera networks and let you control your image, up to monetize your tracking rights with partners,
- [RIP 🪦] 💻🤓🛠️ Boosty, a SaaS to use AI (Computer Vision, NLP and RL) to analyse existing platforms (web or desktop) and generate up-to-date components

I want to work over:

- 🖊️ Kokoi: a SaaS to help writers write
- 💻🤓🛠️ Boosty: make it live again :)
- 🍌🪖 Banana Army: we really need a new no-code platform made for the future 🌏
- a lot of other things!
